![This is a picture of me](../thisIsMe.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

My name is Anton Öberg and im a student att Linnéuniveritetet. Im on my first year as a webdeveloper. For a long time since i was a kid, ive been very intrested in techical hardware but later on ive also been taking interest in software. Its natural a since they go hand in hand with eachother so why not learn how they depend on eachother.

On my free time i like to read and learn about different hardware. Its everything from old ones to the absolute latest. The biggest interest is performance and reliability. 

I have sort of a project on my own, i have my mainrig with a set of carefully chosen components in it. 
Ive been building several computers in my life, mostlly for friends were they put their trust in my ability to bring them a system for their desired needs. And yes! Ive made misstakes while building which ive learned from. One time i accedently cracked my frends brand new I5 6500 and the motherboard cpu socket wasnt that well after the incedent either, but shit happens and i had to pay up for it. It didnt stop me from building computers though, it just halped me be more careful when dealing with expensive components.
